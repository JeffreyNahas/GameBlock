# GameBlock
This project is a Java-based visual game simulation that employs quad-trees to represent a game board reminiscent of a Mondrian painting. Players interact with the game by applying operations like rotation, reflection, and smashing on blocks to achieve goals related to the arrangement of colors on the game board.

Usage
Clone the Repository: Download the project files to your local machine.
Import and Setup: Ensure that all project files, especially Block.java, PerimeterGoal.java, and BlobGoal.java, are within an assignment3 package in your Java development environment.
Run the Simulation: Execute the main class 'BlockGame.java' to start the game. The game allows players to manipulate blocks to meet specified objectives, such as maximizing the contiguous area of a specific color or optimizing color placement at the perimeter.
The game challenges players with randomly generated goals and provides a platform to practice and understand recursive data structures, specifically quad-trees, and their manipulation through user interactions.
